# Summary 
This is a Frequently Asked Questions document for the Paylocity DevSecOps Mid-Level Role Opportunities

# Job Responsibilities/Requirements

## Core Areas of Functionality
1. The DevSecOps teams are responsible for the security of all data and code developed by Paylocity engineers.
2. Paylocity has two DevSecOps teams, one of which focuses on operations, and my team, which looks more forward at new technologies, creates proof of concepts, and builds out integrations.
3. Both teams perform feature and risk advisories, and vulnerability remediation advisories on behalf of our 500+ engineers and test engineers.
4. Both teams write integration code and other types of automation scripting.

## Core Areas of Knowledge
1. Candidates for a mid-level role should:
  a. have working knowledge of Python, including basic package usage, classes, OOP, etc.
  b. have a working knowledge of OWASP Top 10 Web, and preferably OWASP Top 10 API frameworks. This includes the ability to readily identify key vulnerabilities when looking at code samples.
  c. have an understanding of the SDLC and general CI/CD pipeline functionality used to build and deploy code.

## Soft Skills
1. The ability to successfully document project knownledge and vulnerabilities in written form, and present findings to engineers and managers in live or pre-recorded video.
2. An entrepreneurial spirit, looking for opportunities to discover and apply new technologies and techniques using a shift-left security mindset.
3. Candidates will need to be comfortable pivoting from one project to another on an as-needed basis. This is a security team, and as such, members of the team may be called upon to provide emergency advisory services as needed for incident triage, merger & acquisition investigation, zero-day vulnerabilities.
4. The ability to lead one major project at a time, including providing leadership to at least one other team member on the project.
5. The ability to hit the ground running with basic project work while continuing to grow into the role.
6. Patience. New hires onto my team should expect a slow ramp-up into the role. 

# Team Construction
1. The current team has two Principal DevSecOps engineers and two Associate DevSecOps Engineers. Between our Principal Engineers and myself, we have over 50 years experience in software engineering.
2. The DevSecOps teams are part of the Application Security Group, which includes DevSecOps, Vulnerability Assessment, and Offensive Security teams.

# Managerial Style
1. I prefer to use a slow ramp-up into the role, combining small projects and training in order to best set up team members for a series of small successes.
2. I expect mistakes, but I also expect team members to learn and grow from their mistakes and not repeat them.
3. I provide private feedback whenever possible in order to provide team members every opportunity to course-correct prior to review seasons. I make every attempt to deliver feedback that is both timely and actionable in order to best position team members to succeed.
4. I expect team members to be able to receive and process feedback in a professional manner, and create action plans that work for them to move toward a successful outcome.
5. While I do work outside of regular hours because of my work schedule, I do not require any team member to perform work outside of normal hours. In fact, I specifically request team members NOT work outside of normal hours. This is, however, a security team, and there may be rare occasions that require work outside of normal hours. This has happened exactly once in my 4+ years in Application Security.
